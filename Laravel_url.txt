Signed URLs
  For example, you might use signed URLs to implement a public "unsubscribe" link that is emailed to your customers. To create a signed URL to a named route, use the signedRoute method of the URL facade:
  
  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL;
 
  return URL::signedRoute('unsubscribe', ['user' => 1]);
